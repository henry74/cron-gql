> Go-based cron scheduler wrapped in a GraphQL interface

## How to use

### 1. Download code

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:henry74/cron-gql.git
```

### 2. Start the GraphQL server

```sh
go run server/server.go
```

OR

```sh
go build -o bin/cron-gql server/server.go
./bin/cron-gql
```

### 3. Using the GraphQL API

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).

The schema that specifies the API operations of your GraphQL server is defined in [`./schema.graphql`](./schema.graphql). Below are a number of operations that you can send to the API using the GraphQL Playground.

Feel free to adjust any operation by adding or removing fields. The GraphQL Playground helps you with its auto-completion and query validation features.

#### Add a new scheduled job

```graphql
mutation {
  addJob(
    input: {
      cronExp: "0 * * * *"
      rootDir: "/home/henry"
      cmd: "ls"
      args: "-alh"
      tags: ["directory", "hourly"]
    }
  ) {
    jobID
    cronExp
    cmd
    args
    tags
  }
}
```

#### List all scheduled jobs

```graphql
query {
  jobs {
    jobID
    cronExp
    cmd
    args
    tags
    lastScheduledRun
    nextScheduledRun
  }
}
```

> **Note**: You can filter jobs by a specific `jobID` or list of `tags` e.g. using `jobs(input: { tags:["hourly"] }) {...}`.

#### Force a scheduled job to run immediately

```graphql
mutation {
  runJob(JobID: 1) {
    jobID
    cronExp
    cmd
    args
    tags
    lastScheduledRun
    nextScheduledRun
    lastForcedRun
  }
}
```

#### Remove a scheduled job

```graphql
mutation {
  removeJob(JobID: 1) {
    jobID
    cronExp
    cmd
    args
    tags
    lastScheduledRun
    nextScheduledRun
    lastForcedRun
  }
}
```

</Details>

### 4. Changing the GraphQL schema

After you made changes to `schema.graphql`, you need to update the generated types in `./generated.go` and potentially also adjust the resolver implementations in `./resolver.go`:

```sh
go generate ./... # from root
```

This updates `./generated.go` to incorporate the schema changes in your Go type definitions.
